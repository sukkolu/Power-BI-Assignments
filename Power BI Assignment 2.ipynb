    "Here are the solutions to the Power BI Assignment 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Advantages of Natural Queries in Power BI with an example:**\n",
    "Natural Language Queries in Power BI allow users to ask questions about data in a conversational way using plain English. This makes data exploration more accessible, especially for non-technical users. For example, a user could ask \"What were the total sales in the West region last quarter?\" instead of having to construct a complex query or navigate through reports.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Web Front End (WFE) cluster in Power BI Service Architecture:**\n",
    "The WFE cluster handles incoming requests from clients (Power BI Desktop, mobile apps, etc.). It acts as a gateway, authenticating users, rendering reports, and managing user sessions. The WFE cluster load balances requests across multiple nodes for scalability and availability.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Back End cluster in Power BI Service Architecture:** \n",
    "The Back End cluster is responsible for data processing, modeling, and storage. It includes components like the VertiPaq Analytics Engine for in-memory analytics, the Data Movement Service for data refresh, and the Azure SQL databases for storing metadata and caching data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **ASP.NET component in Power BI Service Architecture:**\n",
    "Power BI Service uses ASP.NET as the web application framework for rendering reports, handling user requests, and managing sessions. The WFE cluster runs ASP.NET applications to serve client requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Comparison of Microsoft Excel and Power BI Desktop:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Import:**\n",
    "- Excel: Imports data from various sources like CSV, databases, web data, etc.\n",
    "- Power BI Desktop: Connects to a wide range of data sources, including Excel, databases, cloud services, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Transformation:**\n",
    "- Excel: Provides basic data transformation capabilities through formulas and pivot tables.\n",
    "- Power BI Desktop: Offers powerful data transformation capabilities through the Query Editor (e.g., merging, reshaping, cleaning data).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Modeling:**\n",
    "- Excel: Limited data modeling capabilities through pivot tables and basic relationships.\n",
    "- Power BI Desktop: Robust data modeling capabilities with relationships, calculated columns/tables, and DAX expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reporting:**\n",
    "- Excel: Basic reporting through charts, pivot tables, and formatting.\n",
    "- Power BI Desktop: Advanced reporting with interactive visualizations, dashboards, and sophisticated formatting options.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Server Deployment:**\n",
    "- Excel: No direct server deployment, but workbooks can be shared on SharePoint or other file-sharing platforms.\n",
    "- Power BI Desktop: Reports and datasets can be published to the Power BI Service for sharing and collaboration.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Convert Models:**\n",
    "- Excel: No direct conversion to other models.\n",
    "- Power BI Desktop: Can connect to and import data models from various sources, including Excel workbooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cost:**\n",
    "- Excel: Included in Microsoft Office suite or available as a standalone application with a one-time license fee.\n",
    "- Power BI Desktop: Free to download and use, but the Power BI Service has different pricing tiers based on features and capacity.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **20 data sources supported by Power BI Desktop:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Excel\n",
    "2. CSV\n",
    "3. XML\n",
    "4. JSON\n",
    "5. SQL Server\n",
    "6. Oracle\n",
    "7. MySQL\n",
    "8. PostgreSQL\n",
    "9. Salesforce\n",
    "10. Dynamics 365\n",
    "11. SharePoint\n",
    "12. Azure SQL Database\n",
    "13. Azure Blob Storage\n",
    "14. Azure Data Lake Store\n",
    "15. Google Analytics\n",
    "16. Hadoop File (HDFS)\n",
    "17. Spark\n",
    "18. OData Feed\n",
    "19. Web\n",
    "20. R Script\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Power BI Desktop supports many more data sources, including various cloud services, on-premises databases, and online services.\n",
